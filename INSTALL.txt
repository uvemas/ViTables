System requirements
-------------------
ViTables 3.0.3 has been tested against the latest versions of Python 3,
PyTables and PyQt. You can try other versions at your own risk :).

Installation on a conda environment
-----------------------------------
Using conda you should be able to run vitables on any system, let it
be linux, mac or windows. The following are instructions for linux-like
systems.

Simply run::

  $ conda install -c conda-forge vitables

Installation on Windows and Mac OS X platforms
----------------------------------------------
Currently there are no graphical installers available for these platforms. You
have to install ViTables from the command line, using one of the methods
described in the Linux section.

Installation on Linux platforms
-------------------------------
The Python setuptools are used to build and install ViTables.

The easiest way to install it is to download it from PyPi::

  $ pip install ViTables

Alternatively, you can download the binary package from the download area
(see vitables.org/Downloads for details), go to the directory where you have
downloaded the file and issue the command::

  $ pip install ViTables-3.0.3-py3-none-any.whl

This should install the ViTables wheel.
