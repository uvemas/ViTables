ViTables
--------
ViTables is a graphical tool for browsing and editing files in both PyTables
and HDF5 format. With ViTables you can easily navigate through the data
hierarchy, view and modify metadata, view actual data and more.

ViTables has been developed using Python and PyQt, a binding to Qt
libraries, so it should run on any platform that support these components
(this includes Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and many other Unices). The interface
and features are the same in all platforms. At the moment, ViTables has been
heavily tested on Linux and Windows platforms.

For installation instructions see INSTALL.txt.

send suggestions or features requests.
